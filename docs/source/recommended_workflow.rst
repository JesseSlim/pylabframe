Recommended workflow
====================

To make most out of ``pylabframe``, we recommended a workflow that optimally integrates its components.
On this page, we outline that workflow. However, as ``pylabframe`` is designed with modularity in mind, you are free to
adopt as much or as little of this workflow as you like -- while still using ``pylabframe``'s individual components.
